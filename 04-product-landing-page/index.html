          <h3>Yellowface</h3>
          <p>White lies. Dark humor. Deadly consequences… Bestselling sensation Juniper Song is not who she says she is, she didn’t write the book she claims she wrote, and she is most certainly not Asian American—in this chilling and hilariously cutting novel from R.F. Kuang, the #1 New York Times bestselling author of Babel. </p>

          <h3>If We Were Villains</h3>
          <p>The story of a tightly knit group of seven lyric-mad Shakespearean thespians who seem to prefer each other's company to anyone else's, thereby offending the rest of the world. But as these things so often go, something dark and sinister soon sews hatred in them, and wedges its way between them.</p>

          <h3>Alone with You in the Ether</h3>

Prior to their encounter, he is a doctoral student who manages his destructive thoughts with compulsive calculations about time travel; she is a bipolar counterfeit artist, undergoing court-ordered psychotherapy. By the end of the story, these things will still be true. But this is not a story about endings.</p>
